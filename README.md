# **S4-T: Super-Speed Spy Secure Synchronization Terminal**

Welcome to the official repository for the **S4-T** program, CONTROL’s latest technological masterpiece. Designed by none other than Agent Maxwell Smart (*Agent 86*), the **Super-Speed Spy Secure Synchronization Terminal** promises to revolutionize the way secret agents handle their *super-secret* files... theoretically.

## 🕵️ **What is S4-T?**

The **S4-T** is a cutting-edge (*but kinda impractical*) CLI tool made for spies who need to synchronize files with absolutely NO room for error—except for all the built-in errors Agent Smart accidentally left in.

### Key Features:
- **Super-Speed Synchronization**: Faster than any other synchronization tool, assuming you don’t mind occasionally syncing blank files.  
- **Spy Mode**: Turns the terminal screen black with green neon text to make you feel like a real secret agent (purely decorative).  
- **Self-Destruct Mode**: Deletes your files instantly if you accidentally type the wrong command.  
- **Voice Activation**: Doesn’t work, but it’s fun yelling “SYNCHRONIZE!” at your computer.  
- **Classified Operation**: Maxwell insists the inner workings of the program are so classified, even he doesn’t know how it works!  

> *Warning*: The S4-T may occasionally crash, delete critical infrastructure, or summon the KAOS IT department. Please proceed responsibly.

## 🚀 **Installation**

S4-T requires **absolutely no setup!** Simply shout dramatically, *“Maxwell Smart, 86-approved software, ENGAGE!”* However, if that doesn’t work (it won’t), you can follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- **Operating System**: Linux, MacOS, Windows (*compatible if Maxwell Smart gets lucky*).  
- **Dependencies**: None (*"Most dependencies are optional; just like Maxwell’s qualifications." —Chief*)

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/control-agents/S4-T.git
cd S4-T
```

Run the Program:

python s4-t.py


## 🛠️ **Usage**

Using **S4-T** is easier than infiltrating KAOS headquarters, provided you read these instructions carefully (which Maxwell Smart never does).

### Basic Commands:
| **Command**             | **Description**                                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `sync`                  | Synchronizes your super-secret files (sometimes).       |
| `spy_mode`              | Turns on "Spy Mode" (neon aesthetic for extra flair).   |
| `self_destruct`         | Deletes everything; intended for emergencies, invoked accidentally 97% of the time. |
| `status`                | Checks synchronization progress (usually frozen at 42%).|

### Example:
```bash
> sync
Output: SUCCESS! Super-speed synchronization complete. Total files synchronized: 0
```

## ⚠️ **Known Issues**

### Current Bugs:
- *"Voice activation does not respond to yelling."*  
- *"Spy Mode causes retinal damage with excessive neon glow."*  
- *"Self-Destruct Mode activates with most standard commands."*

## 🤖 **Future Development**

CONTROL’s tech team has issued the following development roadmap:  
- Add **actual synchronization functionality**.  
- Remove **self-destruct mode** unless Agents specifically ask for it (they won’t).  
- Improve compatibility with Maxwell Smart’s infamous **shoe phone**.

> CONTROL has stated that future updates will depend entirely on whether Maxwell Smart stops breaking the current version.

## 📄 **License**

S4-T is licensed under the **CONTROL Super-Secret License**. Unauthorized use will result in Maxwell Smart showing up at your house with a non-functioning shoe phone.

> *Maxwell Smart: "Don’t worry, Chief—I’ve made sure this program is impossible for KAOS to use. Which also means it’s impossible for CONTROL to use. Genius, isn’t it?"*
